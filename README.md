SedSim is an ope-source, daily time step river basin simulation model for flow, sediment and hydropower production in networks of reservoirs and river channels. It is intended to predict in relative terms the spatial and temporal accumulation and depletion of sediment in river reaches and in reservoirs under different reservoir operating and sediment management policies. Thus, the model is expected to be used for estimating sediment transport in river basis including those that have experienced (or will experience) extensive reservoir development. The model's source code (SedSim_Model.xlsm) is written in the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language. The model requires one input file (Microsoft Excel '.xls' format), specified by the user to reflect conditions in the river basin to be modeled. The model produces output files in both ".xls" and ".csv" formats.
