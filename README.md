SedSim

SedSim is a daily time step river basin simulation model for flow, sediment and hydropower production in networks of reservoirs and river channels. It is intended to predict in relative terms the spatial and temporal accumulation and depletion of sediment in river reaches and in reservoirs under different reservoir operating and sediment management policies.
